  journal = {Annals of Mathmatics},

  volume = {155},
  pages = {157-187},
  abstract = {The main contribution of this work is a new type of graph product,
	which we call the zig-zag product. Taking a product of a large graph
	with a small graph, the resulting graph inherits (roughly) its size
	from the large one, its degree from the small one, and its expansion
	properties from both! Iteration yields simple explicit constructions
	of constant-degree expanders of arbitrary size, starting from one
	constant-size expander. Crucial to our intuition (and simple analysis)
	of the properties of this graph product is the view of expanders
	as functions which act as ``entropy wave'' propagators --- they transform
	probability distributions in which en- tropy is concentrated in one
	area to distributions where that concentration is dissipated. In
	these terms, the graph product affords the constructive interfer-
	ence of two such waves. Subsequent work [ALW01], [MW01] relates the
	zig-zag product of graphs to the standard semidirect product of groups,
	leading to new results and con- structions on expanding Cayley graphs.
